  <p>
    apidoc provides support for declaring your own union types
    (sometimes referred to as sum or algebraic types). The basic idea
    is that you can express that a particular variable is one of a
    known set of types.
  </p>

  <p>

    As an example, in an ecommerce system, you might want to accept
    orders from both registered users (people who actually have a
    username and password with your service) and also from guest users
    (e.g. people who have never visited your application before). One
    way to model this is to define two types, Registered User and
    Guest User, a single union type User that can be either a
    Registered User or a Guest User, and then to model your order as
    having a User.
  </p>

  <p>
    Union types, especially when combined with expressive programming
    languages like Scala, can prove to be very useful and pragmatic
    tools for modeling problems like this.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the wire, union types in the play 2_x clients are represented
    as a Json Object with one element. The key is the name of the type
    and the value is the Json serialization of the actual object.
  </p>

  <p>
    Example serializations:

    <pre>
    {
      "registered_user": {
        "guid":"f30dc64e-1793-4d59-aa47-71f000e06851",
        "email":"registered@@gilttest.com"
      }
    }
    </pre>

    <pre>
    {
      "guest_user": {
        "guid":"f30dc64e-1793-4d59-aa47-71f000e06851",
        "email":"guest@@gilttest.com"
      }
    }
    </pre>

  </p>

  <p>

    We also maintain an example application that has a simple union
    type and a controller in play to serialize / deserialize data. For
    more information - we recommending viewing this project and in
